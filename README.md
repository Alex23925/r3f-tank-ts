This repo is for me to accustom to typescript, react, and react three fiber all at the same time by converting my orginal r3f tank with typescript instead.

## Intro

This project is from the threejs fundamentals scene graph page [https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-scenegraph.html] that I implented with react three fiber, react and now typescript.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Reason for doing this

To learn how to use typescript react and react three fiber at the same time. 

## Problems encountered after finishing

The react three fiber library did not have an intrinsic element for type object3D or camera so I had to code them into the three-types.d.ts
